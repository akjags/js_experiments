On each trial, you will first see an image flashed very briefly on the screen - we call this first image the 'sample image'. You will then be shown two images and asked to choose the one which contains the same object as the initially presented sample image. You will indicate your response by pressing either the left arrow key or the right arrow key. After you submit your answer, you will automatically move onto the next question. </p>",

Then the 'sample' image will be shown on the screen and will then quickly disappear, and you will then be shown two choices. You must press either the left arrow key or the right arrow key on your keyboard to indicate which of these two choices is an image of the same object as the sample image. Note that the correct choice may be from a different viewpoint so the object may not look exactly the same, but this is what makes the task challenging! You must identify the match even though it will be a rotated version of that object.</p>"+
